The requirements were to make a state machine that implemented the following equalization algorithm for black and white imagines.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">delta_value = max_pixel_value - min_pixel_value\nshift_level = (8-floor(log2(delta_value + 1)\ntemp_level = (current_pixel_value - min_pixel_value) &lt;&lt; shift_level\nnew_pixel_value = min(255, temp_pixel)</code></pre></div>\n<p>I used a Mealy state machine to create the circuit. It was synthesized with a clock period of 15ns and works pre and post synthesis. Since optimization was not a requirement for the project, I valued code readability higher than using a low amount of states in the state machine.</p>\n<p>You can read the code <a href=\"https://github.com/chiarabia/Progetto-Reti-Logiche-2021/blob/main/progetto%20reti.vhd\">here</a></p>\n<p>You can read a report of the project (in italian)<a href=\"https://github.com/chiarabia/Progetto-Reti-Logiche-2021/blob/main/report.pdf\">here</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Logic Circuits Project","date":"April 2021","tags":null,"description":"Description and syntesis in VHDL of a component that implements histogram equalization of a grey scale image with 256 levels."}}},"pageContext":{"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/smART detective/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"smART detective"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hermann-snake/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hermann Snake"}},"slug":"/Logic Circuits Project/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
