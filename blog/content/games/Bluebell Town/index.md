Bluebell Town is a small management game where the player needs to balance out the needs of a city and the change towards climate-friendly policies. 

The game was inspired by events from where I live, Northern Italy. While people here are open to support helping the environment, sometimes they might be more reluctant if it involves to big of a change. This made me realise that we need to find the right balance between making a positive impact on the climate and meeting the needs of every part of a community. 

The Climate Jam was a one week long jam organised by Indie Cade, Seattle Indies and IGDA Climate. Bluebell town follows the theme of Equilibrium and won a Honorable Mention award.

I worked on the game as the designer, programmer and writer. [In√®s Robin](https://www.ines-robin.com) worked on the art and UI design, meanwhile [Erin Young](https://www.erinyoungmusic.com) and [Christin Cruz](https://www.christiancruzmusic.com) at [Noob Neumes](https://www.instagram.com/noobneumes/?utm_medium=copy_link) worked on the music and sound design.

The game was made with Unity.
