description: Entry for the Cultural Heritage Game Jam. Educational game about italian paintings. 2nd prize winner.
---

smART detective is a small puzzle-educational game where the player is an art conservator trying to save paintings throughout Italy.

The game was made with the idea of being an educational tool for school and museums. By playing the game and interacting with paintings, the player can create an emotional connection that it's much stronger than just seeing the painting on a wall or a textbook.

You can read more about the inspiration and mission for the game [here](https://medium.com/@chiarabianchimani/smart-detective-and-the-importance-of-empathizing-with-cultural-heritage-3415b0201e02).

The Cultural Heritage Game Jam was organised by the Global Game Jam in collaboration with the Cultural Antiquities Task Force of the US government. smART detective was the second prize winner and received the Best Use of Education Design Principles award.

I worked on the game as the game designer, programmer, writer and artist.
