description: Implementation with Java of a boardgame (Santorini) using MVC design patter, server, clients, sockets connectivity, CLI and GUI
---

This project was my thesis for my Bachelor degree. It was complementary to my Software Engineering class. I made it in collaboration with [@MarcelloMatteoDeclich](https://github.com/MarcelloMatteoDeclich) and [@vittoriodani](https://github.com/vittoriodani).

The project consisted in the Java implementation of the tabletop game Santorini.

We were required to use the MVC pattern, create socket connectivity, CLI and GUI.

I worked at the entirety of the GUI and in the implementation and testing of the logic of the game.

You can find the project [here](https://github.com/chiarabia/Soft_Eng_BoardGame_2020). This project is not exactly the same as the one presented as the thesis, since the latter had copyrighted material of the game.
