description: Software that creates runnable code for Arduino that can be used to make music, activate motors and turn on LEDS.

This project was made in collaboration with [Andrea Franchini](https://andreafranchini.com).

The project started with the idea of giving robots, and thus the people programming them, a quick way to give feedback in a human way.
This was achieved with a easy-to-use webapp where the user can create a musical score, activate motors and LEDS and then generate JSOn or Arduino code with their creation.

The webapp is made with React and Redux and by using Typescript. It was made with ease of extensibility in mind. You can read more about it in the [report](https://github.com/QUB3X/composer/blob/master/Report.pdf).

Here is the live [demo](https://composer.netlify.app).
