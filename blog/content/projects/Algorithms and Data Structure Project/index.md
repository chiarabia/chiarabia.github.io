description: Implementation using C of a text editor with commands add, delete, undo, redo. The project had strict time and space constraints. 
---

This project was complementary to my Algorithm and Data structure class.

The requirement of the project was the implementation in C of a text editor with the commands add, delete, undo, redo.

The project purpose was to pass a test suite with strict space and time requirements.

I used circlular double linked lists as the general data structure. For the redo and undo commands I took inspiration from the command design pattern.
